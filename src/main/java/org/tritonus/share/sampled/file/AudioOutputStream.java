/**
 * Represents a one-time writing of audio data to a destination (file or output stream).
 * <p>
 * This interface is the lowest abstraction level of writing audio data.
 * Implementations of this interface should, when write() is called, never
 * do buffering and they should never do format conversions. However,
 * this interface is intended to abstract the file format (how the
 * headers and data chunks look like) and the way of writing to the
 * destination object. (implementation note [non-normative]: the last
 * should be done by using TDataOutputStream implementing classes).
 * <p>
 * One reasoning behind this interface was to allow direct, unbuffered
 * writing of recorded data.
 * In JS API 0.90, there was no obvious way for this.
 * Data have had to be recorded to a buffer, then written to a file
 * from that buffer.
 * This gave problems with long recordings, where the main
 * memory of the machine is not big enough to hold all data. There are
 * two ways so solve this:
 * <p>
 * a) Having a special AudioInputStream that fetches its data from a
 * TargetDataLine. This way, the loop inside the AudioFileWriters reads
 * directely from the recording line via the special AudioInputStream.
 * This is the solution Sun adopted for JS 1.0.
 * <p>
 * b) The other way is to expose a direct interface to the writing of the
 * audio file with no loop inside it. This is to enable the application
 * programmer to write the main loop itself, possibly doing some
 * additional processing inside it. This is the more flexible way.
 * The drawback is that it requires a new architecture for writing files.
 * <p>
 * This interface is the central part of a proposal for the second
 * solution.
 * The idea is now to use the new structure inside the old one to gain
 * experience with it before proposing to make it a public interface
 * (public in the sense that it is part of the javax.sound.sampled
 * package).
