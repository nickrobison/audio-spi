/**
 * A set where the elements are uniquely referenced by their
 * string representation as given by the objects toString()
 * method. No 2 objects with the same toString() can
 * be in the set.
 * <p>
 * The <code>contains(Object elem)</code> and <code>get(Object elem)</code>
 * methods can be called with Strings as <code>elem</code> parameter.
 * For <code>get(Object elem)</code>, the object that has been added
 * is returned, and not its String representation.
 * <p>
 * Though it's possible to store
 * Strings as objects in this class, it doesn't make sense
 * as you could use ArraySet for that equally well.
 * <p>
 * You shouldn't use the ArrayList specific functions
 * like those that take index parameters.
 * <p>
 * It is not possible to add <code>null</code> elements.
